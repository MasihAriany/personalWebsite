My Latest Personal Website.

Website is devided into two main parts ( right and left Hemisphere ). which presents my desire, passion and skills in Art and Programing and Computer Science.

From Home page you can navigate to left and right to see the mentioned parts. ( all are parts of the index.html file )

In Left Hemishpere, my latest Portfolio and why I like what I do professionally was presented
In Right Hemisphere, what I like and pursue in Art was presented. Along with some personal inforamtion.

## Implementation:
 - A Mobile-First approach design
 - AngularJS was used for avoiding Redundant coding and easier handling some changes between Model and View.
But didn't use a separate file for my data in order reduce the number of requests and since the data was not that much.
 - JQuery also were used here and there.
 - Bootstrap as the main Styling tool.
